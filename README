ansible-role-di
===============

This ansible role describe debian-installer installation and
configuration for automatic Debian network installation.

It needs a dhcp server a web server and an apt proxy.


Configuration
-------------

You should take a look at the preseed files (to change at least the default
language and keyboard) and if you are using a serial console the serial port
number is set in the syslinux config files.

The file ``files/authorized_keys`` is missing as it is local data. This file
will be installed in ``/root/.ssh`` on the newly deployed machines.

To adjust the configuration to the local needs the following variables are
available :

  - ``di_proxy``: local apt proxy address
  - ``di_root_password_hash``: initial root password
  - ``di_master``: the master server address on which can be found the pressed
    files and the authorized_keys file (so with an http server and tftp and
    dhcp server)

and the machines to be deployed should have a ``eth0_mac`` variable in the
inventory.


Get the debian installer
------------------------

To download the debian-installer itself for the first time or to get it
updated the variable "fetch_new_debian-installer" should be true.
You can set variables on the command line with ``--extra-vars`` :

    ansible-playbook site.yml --extra-vars "fetch_new_debian-installer=True"
